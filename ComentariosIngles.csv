5.0 de 5 estrellas,"It's one of those books that make you desperate, make you angry, force you to hate some characters and you keep waiting for something to happen that helps you understand what the hell is happening and why it is happening that way. I am not an expert. In books, I can only tell you from my opinion: buy it! It will help you pass the time and without a doubt you will want to finish it just to see the end and discover all the chaos that is forming. There are things that you will surely intuit from the beginning, but there will be others that I assure you, will surprise you.",Miguel Avila,"

2.0 de 5 estrellas,I have 60% but it is a book full of clichés and little phrases of improvement that you find on the internet that are putting together a typical story of an improvement book where ordinary people find a mentor who solves their life ...

"
1.0 de 5 estrellas,"One of the worst books I have read if not the worst. To begin with, the author does it in the format of a novel, putting an enlightened person talking full of flattery about how to unleash our potential in the purest style of a generic motivator or a deceitful religious leader. Among what I have read I have found many valuable phrases but also too much straw, starting with the narrative style, I am not lying, the style can be liked by someone, I know that these books have their audience but in the most objective way that I can tell them , do not waste your time with these types of books, they are not worth it.",José Abraham,"

If you suffer tribulation or anguish, you will be edified with this work and you will be able to see that God is glorified even in the suffering that you suffer. As a chronic and incurable disease patient from my youth, this work also reminds me of the comfort, joy, and peace we have in Christ. I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend it.",JUAN A AGUILAR R,"

"
5.0 de 5 estrellas,"It is a book that helps you bring peace to the soul. As I progressed through this reading I couldn't stop thinking ""wow, I hadn't seen him like that, he's very right."" C.S. Lewis, as always, brings complex issues to light and treats them with such tact and responsibility. I would certainly read it a thousand more times. I recommend reading it carefully, because if you read something at the wrong pace, you could miss something important that the author mentions and you could have a bad vision of what he means, misinterpreting everything. About the enterga, first I got a version of the book It looked old and battered, but Amazon has excellent customer service and they made the switch to me promptly. I appreciate it, that's why the 5 stars are maintained.",Uriel Pérez,"

5.0 de 5 estrellas,"Marina has a perfect life. Three beautiful children (I imagine them güeritos) a good husband, understanding, decent, supportive, wealthy financier. A successful career as a choreographer and dancer with a business to express her art. According to critics, their choreographies are perfect, but they lack soul. And ""the one she finds is because she seeks"" and Marina found it in a man with a macho smell who makes her know the most secret and forbidden corners of her sexuality and who also loves her. He's smart, an outstanding writer, and she falls in love. José Cuauhtémoc has only one drawback; he is a confessed parricide locked up in the Oriente Prison and there, in ""malandrotitlán"", among criminals, corruption, murders, hatred, revenge, love ends, somehow triumphing and the choreographer finds her soul. Written with mastery and with a rhythm that does not allow the book to be released, told in several voices, it is a HIGHLY recommended novel",Janet,Salvar el fuego (Pasta Blanda)

  Muchos dirán que Cervantes es el máximo exponente de nuestra lengua, yo difiero, el mejor es Rulfo que con sólo dos libros dominó la literatura mexicana y yo diría que la hispana, aún sin haber ganado un nobel es por mucho el mejor.García Marquez en mi opinión jamas le dio el reconocimiento a Rulfo por su aportación al Realismo Mágico, el que no crea en ello lea este libro y se dará cuenta del mundo de ensueño al que nos transporta esta obra, la cual ocurre de forma no lineal en esa especie de purgatorio llamado Comala.Sin duda una obra maestra que vale la pena leerse una y otra vez, no cabe duda que todos somos hijos de Pedro Páramo.

  Diseño simplemente hermoso, deberían ponerle más protección al libro, como plástico de burbujas, pues algunas esquinas si alcanzaron a dañarse. En general parece un buen producto, faltará ver qué tan buena es la traducción. Leía comentarios en los que decían que la impresión provocaba que al pasarle el dedo se despintara. Corroboré que es cierto, sin embargo requiere fuerza, así que hay que tratarlo delicadamente.

The illustrations are beautiful, the edition is of good quality and has endured well the use that the child gives it, whom we are teaching to take care of books, but even so if it were thinner it would have already broken.

5.0 de 5 estrellas,"Yuval Noah Harari's clarity of mind and his ability to discern about the future based on 1) the past and 2) the confusing and overwhelming amount of information we have today is amazing. While it is true, as the author firmly says, that you cannot predict what we will be as humans in the year 2050, this book is the closest thing to a guide to understanding the issues that will define where we are heading as a civilization and as a species.",Carlos ,Homo deus: Breve historia del mañana

  Llegó en muy buenas condiciones, me interesaba que así fuera porque ya amazon me había entregado un par de libros maltratados o sucios, pero en este caso todo estuvo impecable.El libro es muy bueno y te hace pensar y reflexionar todo el tiempo, además si ya leíste el anterior: Sapiens (De Humanos a Dioses) este te va a gustar bastante.

  No me malentiendan, el libro es muy bueno. Pero si acabas de leer el anterior (Sapiens, de animales a dioses *super recomendado*), se siente algunos temas repetidos, en especial al principio del libro.Después de la segunda mitad, este nuevo libro se torna interesante por sus propios méritos.

5.0 de 5 estrellas,"

  Después de Sapiens donde nos guío brillante y valientemente por la historia de la humanidad, Yuval Noah Harari nos presenta ahora un atisbo al futuro.Su argumentación es inteligente, fluída y fácil de entender; y contiene un sin número de referencias bibliográficas que sostienen su escalofriante, factible y retante visión de futuro.En mi opinión, el único prietito en el arroz es que al final tuvo que apurar sus conclusiones, dejando algunos cabos sueltos. Incluso me perece que dejó algunas ideas en el tintero; quizás por presión del editor...En resumen, este un libro que, como Sapiens, HAY QUE LEER si queremos entender dónde estamos parados y para dónde vamos.

We are already living many of them. At some points it allows your mind to travel to settings that are seen or seen in science fiction movies. Who does not remember the devices on which you could see the person you were talking to, or the computers in the operating room and you thought, ""When will that become reality"" and now it is.

Basically the purpose of the book is to remove those preconceptions that we have about poverty and see the problem from another perspective, for this they use an innovative study method in the field of economics, where instead of answering the big questions they are dedicated to asking questions They create an experiment and collect the data to offer supported answers (you can find a TedTalk of her on YT about this method). Topics covered are education, nutrition, microfinance, and entrepreneurship. Buying this book is definitely an excellent investment.",Eduardo,"

I think Adam did a good job integrating other characters because it gives us a broader perspective of this world and how alerts affect people's lives and their way of thinking, plus the way everything relates integrates everything.

However I saw that it had very good reviews and people recommended it. In the end, as the author himself says, what happens in the end is not the important thing, but the journey that these two boys undertake who by chance of fate meet. I must say then that the trip is highly registrable. The chemistry between the two characters is wonderful, you believe every moment they spend together and every dialogue they have is brilliant. This makes the ending painful but comforting. I will not spoil much but this love story can be lived together with the characters. You suffer and feel every situation Rufus and Mateo face until the end. I highly recommend it.The delivery by Amazon without complaints. They are the best.",Victor Vera,"

I swear that we can all identify with any of them, regardless of the sexual condition of each one. I really liked the way the author had to treat the ""Obsessive Compulsive Disorder"" that the protagonist suffers, with great naturalness and sensitivity, without doubt with a lot of documentation behind. In addition, it introduces many other topics that made me reflect a lot and that give a lot of richness to the whole story. Without a doubt, this is the best book by Adam Silvera, there is an evolution in EVERYTHING, from the plot, to the construction Of the characters. ""Solo Quedó Nuestra Historia"" is a hard novel full of feeling, with a prose by the author, precious that moves and a perfect ending.",Maria,"

4.0 de 5 estrellas,"4.5/5As all Adam Silvera’s novels, History Is All You Left Me is a contemporary with a roller-coaster of emotions, words left unsaid, forced goodbyes, grief and overcoming the pain.Griffin is dealing with the sudden loss of his ex-boyfriend, Theo. The format in which is written allows us to know about what’s happening in the present, and at the same time, what happened in the past; how their relationship began, how it grew and how they fell each other apart.Griffin and Theo were each other’s first times in so many things, but they were also best friends, so the pain that comes with the loss, is even bigger. Theo represented a light in so many people’s lives that it’s unbelievable he’s gone. And as you probably imagine, not being able to say goodbye to the people we love, brings all sorts of awful feelings that are hard to deal with. Truth is, we deal with the loss in different ways, but one thing for sure is that friends and family can help us heal ourselves, and little by little we can get back on the horse.Still, Griffin is hard on himself because he feels guilty, abandoned, and yes, angry at Theo for leaving him alone even if what happened was an accident. And to put the cherry on top, Jackson, Theo’s current boyfriend, is there too. So it was obvious they don’t get along at the beginning. But eventually, they’re the only ones that understand their pain, so through hits and misses, they overcome the pain that Theo left behind.Grieving is so different from all of us. And this novel moved me in a way that it was hard to process. I've been seeing myself a lot in Griffin because two years ago, I lost the one I've loved the most, and I didn’t have the chance to say goodbye… that brought me to a dark place I've been trying to overcome, so I truly know the struggle he was dealing with. Even as an adult, sometimes life hits you so hard you can barely breathe.Some people say Griffin is selfish, and he truly is, but can you blame him? He’s a teenager that not only lost the love of his life, he also lost a best friend, and there are a lot of emotions to deal with in the first place. Talking about my own experience, we often do reckless things when we are grieving and don’t know how to cope with what we are feeling. Although, I don’t accept nor encourage his actions, I do get where he’s coming from.Anyway, I love contemporaries that make me feel all sorts of things because they feel real, and Adam Silvera is the perfect author for that. He makes me think that life should not be taken for granted, and that we often lose time with hard feelings towards others. There are a lot lessons to be learned in this book, and even though it also takes you to a dark place, it somehow brings hope. For example, I loved the fact that we see them accept Theo’s death, and in the end, they’re in a state of mind where they can say “OK, I lost you. But I cannot be bleeding all the time for you. I gotta take care of myself too.” And that’s a hard step to take, believe me.And also, something that probably doesn’t get called on is that Griffin deals with OCD. I don't struggle the same way he did, but I completely understand how he feels towards some silly things that must be in certain order. So, I'm grateful that an author takes notes of this.I would totally recommend this book even if you're not into YA. Believe me when I tell you, this is a true gem. Adam Silvera has become one of my favorite authors! I can’t wait to read his next work!",Carol Flores,"

  Me encantó la portada del libro. Llegó en perfectas condiciones.  La novela en sí es genial. Te tiene en  suspenso desde la primera sección. No lo he terminado, pero habiendo leído otras novelas de Ágatha Christie estoy segura que el asesino será la persona que menos sospecho.

  Como todas las novelas de esta maravillosa autora, obliga a seguir leyendo para poder intuir quién es el asesino, y como siempre, nunca le atino. Eso es lo interesante de estas obras. Altamente recomendable

  La obra de Agatha Christie no tiene crítica, es excelente como todos sus libros. Esta reseña que escribo es sobre la edición de este libro. La impresión y el tipo de papel es de lo mas corriente que se puede encontrar, la letra obviamente muy pequeña para gastar el mínimo de papel posible, las portadas apenas mas gruesas que el papel de las hojas ( y no por mucho ) y lo más triste es que viene con muchas faltas de ortografía y gramática. Si quieres comprar esta obra te recomiendo mucho que no compres esta edición que ni si quiera viene con el nombre de la editorial por ningún lado. Sin poder asegurarlo a nosotros nos ha parecido una copia bien pirata. Espero te sea útil mi reseña.

  El libro está impreso en una impresora casera, tiene errores de dedo, renglones cortados, pésimo uso de puntuación, el interlineado es muy pequeño y no tiene el mínimo cuidado editorial; falta decir también que la portada está pixeleada. Invito a todos a que no lo compren y no tiren su dinero a la basura.
